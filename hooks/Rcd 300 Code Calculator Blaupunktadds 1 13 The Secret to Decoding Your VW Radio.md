# How to Unlock Your VW RCD 300 Radio Code with Blaupunkt Calculator
 
If you have a Volkswagen car with a RCD 300 radio system, you may need to enter a security code to unlock it after a battery change or a repair. The code is usually found on a sticker in the glove box or the user manual. But what if you lost or misplaced the code? Don't worry, there is a solution: you can use a Blaupunkt calculator to generate the code from the serial number of your radio.
