The game is available on Steam for free, but with some limitations. You can only access certain territories and regions, and you need to buy a DLC to unlock the global access. The DLC costs $4.99, but it is currently on sale for $2.99 until March 23. If you want to support the developer and get the full experience of the game, you can buy the DLC from Steam.
 
However, if you want to try the game for free without any restrictions, there is a way to do that. You can download a cracked file of the game from a torrent site and install it on your PC. This will allow you to load any place on Earth and play the game without paying anything.
 
But before you do that, you should be aware of the risks and consequences of downloading cracked files. First of all, it is illegal and unethical to download cracked files of games. You are violating the copyright laws and the terms of service of Steam. You are also depriving the developer of their income and their hard work.
 
Secondly, downloading cracked files can expose your PC to viruses, malware, spyware, and other harmful programs. You never know what kind of files you are downloading from untrusted sources. You could end up damaging your system or compromising your personal information.
 
Thirdly, downloading cracked files can affect your gaming experience. You may encounter bugs, glitches, errors, crashes, or performance issues that are not present in the official version of the game. You may also miss out on updates, patches, fixes, or new features that the developer may release in the future.
 
So, if you want to download Generation Streets game for free, you have two options: either download the free version from Steam and enjoy the limited territories, or buy the DLC and get the global access. Both options are legal, safe, and ethical. Downloading a cracked file is not worth it.
